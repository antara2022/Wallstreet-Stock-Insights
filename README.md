## Wallstreet Stock Insights
Analyzes Financial Data using VBA

## Objectives
### Step 1 - Stock Outputs
- Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year (2018) and outputs the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The total stock volume of the stock

### Step 2 - Add Functionality
